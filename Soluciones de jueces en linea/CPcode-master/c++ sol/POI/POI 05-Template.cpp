/*
	The best substring will obviously be both a prefix and suffix, so we can use that to our advantage to use prefix function
for dp transitions. For each prefix to index i, hold p[i] = prefix function, dp[i] = shortest template and f[i] = largest prefix of
string that can be covered with prefix i so far. If a shorter prefix than i can be used, it will be the value x = dp[p[i] - 1], 
since f[x] will be at least as far forward as f[p[i] - 1] as we already know x can create any instance of the prefix p[i] by the dp
definition, so any prefix that can be created by p[i] can also be created by x, while x could also appear in more instances as well
and is shorter, so it is overall better. This means you can just test if f[x] < i - x - 1. If it is, that value won't work, so set
dp[i] = f[i] = i since only using the whole prefix is the only valid answer. Otherwise, dp[i] = x and the new value of f[x] = i.
