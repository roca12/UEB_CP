  Because you can query every possible combination in one round, you might as well precompute all ahead of time, as this is faster.
I essentially do dp where i start out with easily computing all paths of length t from i to all other nodes j, making sure i is
not used in cycle, then subtracting out paths with at least one cycle with j that doesn't include i. The states are:

f[t][i][j] = all paths length t from i to j with i only used at start
ff[t][i][j] = all cycles length t that use i only for start and end and don't touch j
fs[t][i][j] = combinations of multiple cycles that start and end at i and don't touch j
dp[t][i][j] = number of paths from i to j that only use i at start and j at end
s[t][i][j] = number of combinations of dp[l][i][j] * fs[t - l][j][i], used to cut factor from transitions

Our end goal is to compute dp[t][i][j] = f[t][i][j] - sum of f[l][i][j] * ff[t - l][j][i], because we want to subtract each invalid
path which will definitely have at least one cycle at the end, and can have any path to j with or without cycles before that. Only
multiplying by a single final cycle makes sure we don't overcount.

We can count ff[t][i][j] by counting f[t][i][i] - sum of all cycles from i that use j at least once. All cycles that use j at least once 
will be in the form of dp[p][i][j] * fs[p - l][j][i] * dp[t - l][j][i], because this will make sure we only go from i to j back to i with
only using i and j once in cycle, but we can also use many cycles with j that don't include i in between those paths. We can compute fs
easily with transition fs[t][i][j] = sum of fs[l][i][j] * ff[t - l][i][j] because we can use many cycles before but each combination will
have at least one final cycle at the end. Finally, to cut out a factor of k from time complexity, just store s[i][j] = sum of all 
dp[l][i][j] * fs[t - l][j][i] so you can do transitions of cycles from i using j at least once as sum of s[l][i][j] * dp[t - l][j][i].

This leaves a total time complexity of O(n^2 * k * (n + k)), or since n is approximately k, O(n ^ 4), which is plenty fast enough,
and we just output queries in O(1).
