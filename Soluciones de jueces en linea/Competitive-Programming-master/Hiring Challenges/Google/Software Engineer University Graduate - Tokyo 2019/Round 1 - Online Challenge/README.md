Thank you for applying for the Class of 2019 Software Engineer position at Google. The first step of the interview process is an online coding challenge. You will be able to see the coding problems when it starts, but please make sure to read the below information before proceeding.

# Date and Time:

Wednesday, February 21, 18:00 - 20:00 (Japan Standard Time)

# Required tools:

You will need a machine with access to the internet and development environment (for compiling and executing the programs you write)

# Eligibility:

-   Currently pursuing a BS, MS or PhD degree in Computer Science or related technical field at a university.
-   Be able to start after January 2019 at the Tokyo office. You cannot start from 2018.

# Rules of participation:

-   The online coding challenge consists of two tasks. When the challenge starts, you will be able to see a menu on the left side containing the coding problems. Feel free to start with the task that you feel most comfortable with.
-   The time limit is 120 minutes for the two problems. Remaining time will be shown at the top right section of this site. Feel free to use your favorite programming language to solve them.
-   Each task provides input data and directions for generating an output. Your program can process the input in any way that you’d like (you can even embed it directly in your source code).
-   Please submit the output and the source code you wrote using the answer submission section at the bottom of each problem.
-   You can submit the output and the source code as many times as you’d like until the time limit, but only your last correct submission for each task will be considered. (In case you cannot make a correct submission, your last submission will be considered.)
-   Even if your code is incomplete it will be considered for partial credit as long as it's submitted within the time limit. In this case, please generate a file containing “N/A” and submit it as the output file.
-   You must submit your answers within the time limit. The accuracy of your output is the most important factor in your evaluation, and quality of your code is the second important factor; the speed of submission and the number of times you submit are far less important.
-   During the challenge, you are allowed to browse other websites ONLY to access standard library references, programming language references, and online dictionaries.
